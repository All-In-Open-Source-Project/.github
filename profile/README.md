Through a carefully curated curriculum, we empower individuals at every stage of their journey to contribute to open source projects, helping them develop both the technical and ethical skills needed to drive positive social change. Our goal is to cultivate a community of socially conscious developers who create technology that benefits everyone and contributes to a world where all can thrive.

### Our Pillars:
GitHub All In Open Source spans across three pillars of programming:
- **Skilling**: Offering resources to upskill developers, from newcomers to advanced professionals.
- **Equity**: Promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech ecosystem, ensuring equitable access to opportunities for all.
- **Community**: Building a global, inclusive open-source community through partnerships, mentorship, and collaboration.

Our mission is to empower individuals from all backgrounds through accessible, equitable education in open source and AI. We aim to bridge the opportunity gap by providing resources, support, and collaborative platforms that enable meaningful participation and individual growth, fostering a shared commitment to skill development and inclusive tech advancement.

We strive to change the face of developers by creating a world where everyone, regardless of background, has the opportunity to thrive in the open source and AI industries. We envision a future where diverse voices drive innovation and where a global community of socially conscious developers collaborate seamlessly to solve complex challenges and shape technology for the common good.


### Our Values:
We’ve built core values that serve as the foundation across our pillars of work. With these guiding principles in mind, we aim to build our community with developers, for developers.

1. **Inclusivity**:  
   We aim to create opportunities for everyone to get involved and succeed in open source and AI. We do this by making our resources accessible, localized, and personalized. Our focus on inclusivity ensures that all voices are heard, barriers are removed, and developers stay with us because they feel welcomed and valued.

2. **Collaboration**:  
   We believe that collaboration and partnerships drive innovation and learning. By teaming up with individuals, organizations, communities, and teams at GitHub and Microsoft, we work together to reach common goals and support each other’s growth. 

3. **Empowerment**:  
   We are dedicated to empowering learners through accessible education and resources. Our aim is to build confidence and competence, enabling individuals to take ownership of their learning journey and contribute meaningfully to the field.

4. **Equity**:  
   We are committed to addressing disparities and promoting fairness in tech. Our focus on equity drives us to ensure that everyone has equal access to opportunities and resources, regardless of their starting point.

5. **Community**:  
   We believe in the strength of a connected community. By nurturing a supportive network of learners and professionals, we aim to create an environment where knowledge is shared, relationships are built, and collective progress is achieved.
